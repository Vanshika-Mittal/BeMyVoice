# Be My Voice

Inclusion is possible when you reduce dependency. Voice Assistants are the technology of the future and are activated by verbal commands. Choosing to benefit from digital technology, the Be My Voice app empowers the voiceless by enabling them to live a more independent life.

This app can also be used by young toddlers who can't form meaningful sentences yet to interact with voice assistants at home.

Be My Voice is a completely offline app and doesn't require internet connection.

It provides access to Google Home, Amazon Alexa and even satisfies the need to just express your own wish with the plain text (My Voice) option.

Simply save your frequently used commands, place your phone next to the assistant and tap on the command you wish to give.
